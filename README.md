## Development

The Makefile provides a few targets to help ensure the code is linted and tested.

```console
lint                           Runs golangci-lint. Override defaults with LINT_RUN_OPTS
test                           Runs go test. Override defaults with GOTEST_OPT
coverage                       Generates a coverage profile and opens a web browser with the results
proto                          Regenerate protobuf files
```
