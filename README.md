## Development

The Makefile provides a few targets to help ensure the code is linted and tested.

```console
$ make help
target                         help
------                         ----
lint                           Runs golangci-lint. Override defaults with LINT_RUN_OPTS
test                           Runs go test. Override defaults with GOTEST_OPT
coverage                       Generates a coverage profile and opens a web browser with the results
proto                          Regenerate protobuf files
ci-lint                        Runs the ci based lint job locally.
ci-test                        Runs the ci based test job locally
ci-coverage                    Runs the ci based coverage job locally
